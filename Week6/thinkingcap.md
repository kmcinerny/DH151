<h3> What are your thoughts on "thick mapping in the digital humanities," and how does it differ from "mapping?"<h3>

Thick mapping allows for moving layers of exploration and analysis of humanistic questions that traditional mapping does not. 

Mapping is a way of representing space and presenting an argument about spatial relationships. In historical, colonial cartography, maps created and reified violent power structures. Maps today can still assert power structures such as settler colonialism through modern-day digital GIS, used for drilling oil or surveilling Black and Brown communities. 

Thick mapping seeks to subvert those power dynamics, both by introducing critical narratives and by "interrogating the very possibility of data, mapping, and cartographic representational practices."
