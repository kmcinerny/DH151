<h3> What are your thoughts on "thick mapping in the digital humanities," and how does it differ from "mapping?"</h3>

<p> Thick mapping allows for moving layers of exploration and analysis of humanistic questions that traditional mapping does not. It builds on base ideas of mapping with multi-media context, history, number crunching, connections to other matter, and ethical questions in a way that is exciting to me-- as I, since a child, have been digging to figure out "why" and "how," not only conceptually but in an embodied, spatial sense. That is why I love the references to "drilling down" at a certain place across space-time, "conjuring and caring for ghosts."  

Mapping is a way of representing space and presenting an argument about spatial relationships. In historical, colonial cartography, maps created and reified violent power structures. Maps today can still assert power structures such as settler colonialism through modern-day digital GIS, used for drilling oil or surveilling Black and Brown communities. 

Thick mapping seeks to subvert those power dynamics, both by introducing critical narratives and by "interrogating the very possibility of data, mapping, and cartographic representational practices." Thick mapping includes multiple layers and means of communicating "data," not only latitude and longitude points or polygons, but also photographs, videos, sketches, social media posts, and audio material. Thick mapping engages with critical resistance and "counter-mapping" projects, which defy traditional colonial representations of the earth and space through artistic renderings, analyses of the machinery of power, and centering of marginalized people and their narratives. </p>
