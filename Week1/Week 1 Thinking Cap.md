This site tells multi-layered stories of Indigenous LA through maps, photographs, and written narrative. "Indigenous LA," in the site's story map, includes history and narrative about the Tongva people, the traditional caretakers of the Los Angeles Basin, along with narratives on other Indigenous groups who have migrated to Los Angeles- including American Indians from other tribes, Pacific Islanders, and Indigenous people of Mexico, such as Zapotecs from Oaxaca.

This website speaks to me because it de-colonizes cartography (a historically colonial practice)  by centering the stories of Indigenous people, who are often invisiblized. It brings historical context of Indigenous populations and settler colonialism of the land that UCLA sits on (also the area where I was born and raised).

The mapping works by showing sites of Tongva Territory. The main way they do this is through pictures, which works well for the narrative but could be made stronger through the use of an actual map (i.e. long/lat coordinates). I see how a current-day map or basemap could be limiting, though, because they often include English/settler colonial placenames instead of traditional Tongva placenames.

Mapping Indigenous LA's main platform of choice is ESRI Story Maps. This format allows for incorporation of narrative and images -- contextualizing and critiquing maps that so often stand alone. The story maps platform is great and available to the public (unlike some other ESRI products- but that is not an issue in this story map).

I would not personally change something because it is not my story to tell. However, as I said above, it could be cool to incorporate maps with long/lat to show, for example, where exactly the Kuruvungna village was (etc.).
