    <h1>About Kate</h1>

    <p>I am a third year at UCLA studying Public Affairs with a minor in Digital Humanities. 
        I entered the Digital Humanities minor mostly because of my interest in <b>mapping</b> so I'm excited to strengthen my GIS skills through this course. 
        That being said, I'm quite a <i>novice</i> in coding, especially the programs and languages we're using in this course. 
        That's where I get a little <b>nervous.</b> 
        Otherwise I'm psyched to create a mapping website and analyze data/ form narratives through maps. 
        I'm especially interested in critical cartography and community-led research, so I love the idea of mapping in pursuit of justice/ in service of community-based orgs (Million Dollar Hoods-style). 
    </p>
    <p>Here's the most recent historical storymap I worked on, which includes a georeferenced 1921 map and digitized buildings that uncover Los Angeles's Old Chinatown prior to its demolition:
